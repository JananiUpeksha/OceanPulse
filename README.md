OceanPulse is a Java and JavaFX-based Point of Sale System (POSS) created as a first-semester final project. This project allowed me to gain a thorough understanding of Java programming, the Singleton design pattern, and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Through the development of OceanPulse, I acquired hands-on experience with JavaFX for building user interfaces, applied the Singleton pattern to manage application state efficiently, and utilized the MVC paradigm to ensure a clean separation of concerns within the application. This project significantly enhanced my knowledge of Java development and my ability to design and implement scalable software solutions.
